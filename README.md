# Lead-Generation-System-Google-Maps-to-Email-Scraper-with-Google-Sheets-Export-
This workflow creates a completely free Google Maps email scraping system that extracts unlimited business emails without requiring expensive third-party APIs. Built entirely in N8N using simple HTTP requests and JavaScript, this system can generate thousands of targeted leads for any industry or location while operating at 99% free cost structure.

Benefits
Zero API Costs - Operates entirely through free Google Maps scraping without expensive third-party services
Unlimited Lead Generation - Extract emails from thousands of Google Maps listings across any industry
Geographic Targeting - Search by specific cities, regions, or business types for precise lead targeting
Complete Automation - From search query to organized email list with minimal manual intervention
Built-in Data Cleaning - Automatic duplicate removal, filtering, and data validation
Scalable Processing - Handle hundreds of businesses per search with intelligent rate limiting
How It Works
Google Maps Search Integration:

Uses strategic HTTP requests to Google Maps search URLs
Processes search queries like "Calgary + dentist" to extract business listings
Bypasses API restrictions through direct HTML scraping techniques
Intelligent URL Extraction:

Custom JavaScript regex patterns extract website URLs from Google Maps data
Filters out irrelevant domains (Google, schema, static files)
Returns clean list of actual business websites for processing
Smart Website Processing:

Loop-based architecture prevents IP blocking through intelligent batching
Built-in delays and redirect handling for reliable scraping
Processes each website individually with error handling
Email Pattern Recognition:

Advanced regex patterns identify email addresses within website HTML
Extracts contact emails, info emails, and administrative addresses
Handles multiple email formats and validation patterns
Data Aggregation & Cleaning:

Automatically removes duplicate emails across all processed websites
Filters null entries and invalid email formats
Exports clean, organized email lists to Google Sheets
Required Google Sheets Setup
Create a Google Sheet with these exact column headers:

Search Tracking Sheet:

searches - Contains your search queries (e.g., "Calgary dentist", "Miami lawyers")
Email Results Sheet:

emails - Contains extracted email addresses from all processed websites
Setup Instructions:

Create Google Sheet with two tabs: "searches" and "emails"
Add your target search queries to the searches tab (one per row)
Connect Google Sheets OAuth credentials in n8n
Update the Google Sheets document ID in all sheet nodes
The workflow reads search queries from the first sheet and exports results to the second sheet automatically.

Business Use Cases
Local Service Providers - Find competitors and potential partners in specific geographic areas
B2B Sales Teams - Generate targeted prospect lists for cold outreach campaigns
Marketing Agencies - Build industry-specific lead databases for client campaigns
Real Estate Professionals - Identify businesses in target neighborhoods for commercial opportunities
Franchise Development - Research potential markets and existing competition
Market Research - Analyze business density and contact information across regions
Revenue Potential
This system transforms lead generation economics:

$0 per lead vs. $2-5 per lead from paid databases
Process 1,000+ leads daily without hitting API limits
Sell as a service for $500-2,000 per industry/location
Perfect for agencies offering lead generation to local businesses
Difficulty Level: Intermediate
Estimated Build Time: 1-2 hours
Monthly Operating Cost: $0 (completely free)

This comprehensive tutorial shows the real development process - including writing custom JavaScript, handling rate limits, and building systems that actually work at scale without getting blocked.

Set Up Steps
Basic Workflow Architecture:

Set up manual trigger for testing and Google Sheets integration
Configure initial HTTP request node for Google Maps searches
Enable SSL ignore and response headers for reliable scraping
URL Extraction Code Setup:

Configure JavaScript code node with custom regex patterns
Set up input data processing from Google Maps HTML responses
Implement URL filtering logic to remove irrelevant domains
Website Processing Pipeline:

Add "Split in Batches" node for intelligent loop processing
Configure HTTP request nodes with proper delays and redirect handling
Set up error handling for websites that can't be scraped
Email Extraction System:

Implement JavaScript code node with email-specific regex patterns
Configure email validation and format checking
Set up data aggregation for multiple emails per website
Data Cleaning & Export:

Configure filtering nodes to remove null entries and duplicates
Set up "Split Out" node to aggregate emails into single list
Connect Google Sheets integration for organized data export
Testing & Optimization:

Use limit nodes during testing to prevent IP blocking
Test with small batches before scaling to full searches
Implement proxy integration for high-volume usage
Advanced Optimizations
Scale the system with:

Multi-Page Scraping: Extract URLs from homepages, then scrape contact pages for more emails
Proxy Integration: Add residential proxies for unlimited scraping without rate limits
Industry Templates: Create pre-configured searches for different business types
Contact Information Expansion: Extract phone numbers, addresses, and social media profiles
CRM Integration: Automatically add leads to sales pipelines and marketing sequences
Important Considerations
Rate Limiting: Built-in delays prevent IP blocking during normal usage
Scalability: For high-volume usage, consider proxy services for unlimited requests
Compliance: Ensure proper usage rights for extracted contact information
Data Quality: System includes filtering but manual verification recommended for critical campaigns
